About Ahmed:
Hi, I'm Ahmed. This website is some sort of accountability tool where I publicise what I'm working on, therefore I feel some sort of pressure to get it done. I'm academically trained in both Bioengineering and Chemical Engineering and very much all about bringing those two together. At Multus I do that by translating winning formulations into scaled processes for validation and testing. Outside of work, I keep myself busy with Ecosystem building, writing, wacky projects and a variety of sports.

Work Experience:
Bioprocess Engineer at Multus (2023-); Process Engineer at Eridia (2023-2023); Biotechnologist at Oxford Biomedica (2021-2022); Lab Technician at The UK Biocentre (2020-2021)

Career Goal:
In a lot of biotechs, there is a requirement for wetlab, hardware and data expertise. Ideally, I want the skills I'm building to serve this niche; becoming some sort of turnkey whizz who is equally capable of designing and executing experiments, setting up processes and building great data tools.

Skills: 
Python(?kinda), Internal Audit, Building Quality Management Systems, Internal Audit, Animal Cell Culture Scale-Up, Method Development, Working With Different Cloning Workflows, Some Lab Automation (Tecan and Hamiltons to be precise). I'm also a certified forklift driver!
